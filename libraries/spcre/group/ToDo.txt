SPCRE

Currently, it is mostly a direct port of Google's C++ wrapper
around PCRE for Symbian so there is still quite a bit lacking.

* Add Locale support
* Support more PCRE options in TRegExArg
* Refactor to use more templates and less macros in TRegExArg.
* Full UCS2 support and not just UTF8. Unfortunately, this may slow things down
  as PCRE doesn't support this natively so some wastefull conversion will have
  to take place.
* Port unit tests over to TEF. Will get rid of lots of code duplication.
* Include CRadix parsing
